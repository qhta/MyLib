    <description>Ordinal number is a sequence of segments separated by dots. A segment is a cardinal number from 0 to 16777215.
Each segment number can be directly followed by its variant symbol  - a letter from "a" to "z" (or two letters).
Variant "a" is the first, variant "z" is 26th. If a segment has more variants than 26 then subsequent variants are symbolized by two-letter sequences: "aa", "ab", "ac" till "iu" (last possible variant is 255th).
Ordinal numbers are easily converted to/from strings. One-segment ordinal numbers (without) variants are compatible with integer numbers, two-segment ordinal numbers are compatible with real numbers.</description>
